It is a big opportunity for me to work in such a big game, there are many challenges, one of them being understanding the huge and old codebase, but I will embrace it and try my best to contribute to it. One of the most intricate features I've implemented is the Arch of Thunder, a unique eagle-shaped crossbow capable of firing lightning arrows. Its capabilities extend beyond my description; you must witness it firsthand here: https://www.facebook.com/hachihao792001/videos/696523142425505",
